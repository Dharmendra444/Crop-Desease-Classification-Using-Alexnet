Introductoin:
Crop diseases are major problem in the field of Agriculture, but their rapid identification is very difficult due to the lack in the technologies.Advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning made easy the way to disease detection and diagnosis. 
Using the dataset of the crop leaf numberd 54,300 we implimented a deep convolutional neural network to identify 5 crop species and 26 diseases . The trained model achieves an accuracy of 94 percent  on a set of  image  different from the images which was used for training - the model still achieves an accuracy of 31.4 percent. This accuracy is better than the random proposed model for improving the general accuracy we need a large set of dataset. Overall when we use a large dataset to train the deep learning network it gives a clear picture of desease detection.
